## Cluster Beauty Analysis

Aattractiveness distributions do not accord with normal distribution in the violin plot of the below Figure. So, the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests are used to compared the difference between two neighbor clusters. The investigation of the attractiveness distribution of different facial shape clusters reveals that the facial shapes with more pointed chin have higher attractiveness, regardless of male and female.
